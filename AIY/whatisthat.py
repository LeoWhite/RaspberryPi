The functions in this file provides examples for taking photos, processing them
via the Google ImageAnnotatorClient API and returning an appropiate text string
to be spoken.

It is setup to run on a Raspberry Pi as part of the Google Voice AIY project,
but could be modified to run on other platforms (The only OS specific component
is taking the phots)
